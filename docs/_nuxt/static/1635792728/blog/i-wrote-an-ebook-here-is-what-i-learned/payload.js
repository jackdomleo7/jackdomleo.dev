I utilised this time focusing on my development skills by learning new tools, languages, and programming and design concepts. I could feel myself approaching a burnout because I was doing something developer-related almost all day, every day. It's fair to say I was getting a little bored of coding at that time and I just needed something else to do. Since I've always wanted to write an ebook at some point in my career, I felt now (summer "},{type:b,tag:r,props:{dateTime:k},children:[{type:a,value:k}]},{type:a,value:") would be a perfect time to start, and would be a nice break from constant coding."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"At such a young age, I've felt for a long time that I've achieved so much in so little time and have made some really good choices with my career that I feel were the best choices for me. I have no degree (only my school education), never completed my apprenticeship due to redundancy and have faced the 'age' issue for quite a while. Don't worry, I wasn't made redundant for any other reason than the company I was employed at as an apprentice went bankrupt. From what I've gained in such little time and the knowledge I do know about levelling up careers, I decided to base the topic of my ebook on this - this ebook has become very popular primarily amongst new\u002Fjunior developers.

Firstly, printed books cost a lot of money for the raw materials and the printing process, which is the kind of money I don't have, whereas the cost for making a single ebook costs nothing (if you exclude writing hours). This ties in really well with being green and looking after the environment by not using a lot of paper and ink. Ebooks are ever-growing extremely popular since a lot of people love reading books on their mobile phones and\u002For tablet devices from anywhere, whereas with a book you might forget to take it with you.
