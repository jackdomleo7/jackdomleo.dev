## What was holding me back from writing about tech?

My own tech blog has been on my to-do list for a while but never had the guts to go through with it.

Why?

Firstly, I'm not the best writer, I achieved a grade B in GCSE English Language and a grade C in GCSE English Literature and my vocabulary range is next to nothing. I am confident writing blogs and articles will help improve those key skills.

Secondly, from the time of writing this article, I have only been a developer for 618 days (that is approximately 1 year and 8 months) and I've always felt I've never seen enough of the developer community to start writing about it and sharing my thoughts, advice and knowledge. I always felt too young and too inexperienced. Imposter syndrome...

## What convinced me to start writing?

I have come to realise that no matter what age you are in the development community, you are somewhat young and inexperienced because it is a forever changing, fast-moving industry. Whether you've got 20 years of experience or 1 year and 8 months experience, if a new web framework was released tomorrow, you would both be inexperienced to it and relatively young to the framework's lifecycle. However, it is a given that the person with 20 years of experience would have seen many more frameworks, therefore would have more experience in recognising framework patterns, but that is OK. Never compare yourself to others, no matter who they are because **you are on your own journey** and they are on their's.

I always had the fear I would write something wrong, but it's just a blog, there's **no right or wrong answer**, it's just your thoughts, not everyone has to agree. You have to be ready to accept **any** feedback. It would be a different story if it were writing documentation, but it's not.

I took the time to read other blogs and study how they are structured. Some of my favourites are [DEV](https://dev.to), [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com), [CodePen](https://blog.codepen.io) and [Colby Fayock](https://www.colbyfayock.com). I also took time to read some blogs from some of my colleagues at [Mitrefinch](https://www.mitrefinch.co.uk), such as [Jamie Lord](https://lord.technology/blog). Reading articles written by other developers sharing their experiences, thoughts and advice inspired me to write my own.

I found myself at this inspiring article by [Colby Fayock](https://twitter.com/colbyfayock), "[How to Overcome Your Fear of Writing and Find Motivation to Start](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/overcoming-your-fear-of-writing-and-how-you-can-find-motivation)". Colby talks about imposter syndrome and how writing can improve your attitude towards imposter syndrome and ultimately increase confidence in yourself. üëè

## What do I plan on writing about?

Before deciding to start writing, I never knew what I could write about that potential readers would find interesting and/or educational. So I created my own backlog of article title ideas. I would then come up with article section titles for each article and if I thought the titles and section titles were something I was comfortable writing about, I moved that idea into the 'TO DO' list. Once I had 4 or 5 article ideas, I was convinced I should start writing.

I plan on writing about all things development and tech-related:
- My experiences learning something new
- Any advice, tips or tricks I may have
- An overview of a tech event I attended
- And more to be confirmed

## Who is my target audience?

I would love for my articles to reach as many front-end developers, web developers and designers as possible. I feel there is an amazing developer community on Twitter who are always extremely helpful, inspiring and positive! I would really like my articles to be read and be provided feedback because this interaction is beneficial for everyone.

I also hope my articles reach junior developers. One of my goals is to inspire as many junior developers as I can to get into tech and follow their own path.

## What do I recommend for those who don't write yet?

Definitely consider it.
