If like me, you own a blog, you may ask yourself if it's ever a good idea to clean it out from time to time.

Old and outdated articles are like expired products on a shop shelf—they might look fine at first glance, but they damage your reputation when customers realise they're past their sell-by date. **Blog maintenance** is crucial for maintaining search engine rankings and providing value to your audience.

## Why Blog Cleaning Matters

Regular **content auditing** provides several benefits:

- **Improved SEO performance**: Fresh, relevant content ranks better
- **Enhanced user experience**: Visitors find valuable, up-to-date information  
- **Better site authority**: Search engines favour well-maintained sites
- **Focused messaging**: Content aligns with your current brand and audience

There are three primary reasons why an article should be considered for cleaning:

1. **Outdated content** - can be rewritten and updated
2. **Outdated content** - cannot be rewritten (the topic is no longer relevant)
3. **Subject or style of writing** may no longer align with you or your audience

## 1. Outdated Content That Can Be Updated

More often than not, an article's subject or content is likely to become old news.

Depending on the subject, the time in which an article is considered outdated can vary wildly. Typically, in tech (the main focus of my blog), the average time a particular thing is considered relevant and modern is 18 months. This means, after 18 months of an article being published on a given subject, at least some of its content may no longer be relevant.

This presents a perfect opportunity for **content refreshing**—keeping your content fresh and your audience trusting your ability to keep up with the times whilst not showing them anything that may no longer be of any use to them.

### Content Update Strategies

There are two ways to rewrite an article. Either approach is fine but should be chosen based on preference and the best need for the blog. Both approaches work for articles with high organic SEO ratings that you'll want to maintain:

1. **Keep updating the original article** (evergreen approach)
2. **Write an entirely new article**

### 1.1 Evergreen Content Updates

This approach is the simpler of the two. Essentially, just keep updating and publishing updates and new content to the original article as if it were a "living document".

This approach only works, though, if you state at the top of the article "Updated on" with the date and/or time the article was last updated. Otherwise, the user won't know how fresh the content is or if the article ever gets updates. This should be stated below the "Published on" line to show that this article gets updates. You should refrain, however, from displaying "Updated on" if an article has never been updated, since "Updated on" will show the same date as "Published on".

**Advantages:**
- No need for redirects or SEO management
- Maintains existing backlinks and authority
- Simple implementation
- Preserves social media shares and engagement

**SEO Enhancement Tip:** If you're more technical and want an extra potential SEO boost to improve your article's metadata, you can add the `article:modified_time` [Open Graph metadata](https://ogp.me/) to the `<head>` of your HTML:

```html
<head>
  <meta property="og:type" content="article" />
  <meta property="article:published_time" content="2021-10-31" />
  <meta property="article:modified_time" content="2023-02-16" />
</head>
```

**Disadvantage:** If your blog is architected to show newer articles towards the top, any articles you update will likely still be low down in the list. This can be easily remedied by either rearchitecting the order to prioritise latest published or latest updated, or by adding advanced filter/sort functionality.

### 1.2 Writing Entirely New Articles

If updating the same article is not for you and you'd rather write an entirely new article, this approach requires more setup but can be effective for **content migration**.

This new article should be written as if it were brand new and not a rewrite, whereby you should not reference or link to the old article.

**SEO Best Practices:** For optimal SEO benefit, delete the old article and set up a [301 (Permanent redirect)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/301) from the old article URL to the new article URL. By implementing a 301 redirect, all the SEO "juice" earned by the old article transfers to the new article, and any backlinks referencing the old article will automatically redirect users to the new version.

**Alternative approaches:**
- **404 or 410 responses**: You could delete the old article and return a [404 (Not found)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404) or [410 (Gone)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/410) status code, but you won't get the SEO or UX benefits that a 301 redirect provides.

**Keeping the old article:** If you're absolutely intent on keeping and not deleting the old article, there are steps you could take to ensure maximum benefit of the new article:

1. Add a prominent link at the top directing users to the newer version
2. Add a canonical link pointing to the new article
3. Include `article:expiration_time` Open Graph metadata

```html
<head>
  <link rel="canonical" href="NEW_ARTICLE_URL" />
  <meta property="og:type" content="article" />
  <meta property="article:published_time" content="2021-10-31" />
  <meta property="article:expiration_time" content="2023-02-16" />
</head>
```

The canonical link tells search engines that this page is equivalent to a different page, and all organic SEO earned should be attributed to the canonical URL. The `article:expiration_time` metadata provides additional information about when the article expires.

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires more setup for proper deletion and redirects
- May take longer to completely rewrite than to update existing content
- Potential temporary SEO impact during transition

## 2. Irrelevant Content That Cannot Be Updated

For some topics, it is inevitable that they will reach the point where the entire topic is just no longer relevant. It's not worth rewriting, it can't be updated, and it's not adding any value to your blog.

Over time, old articles whose content has not been updated for a long period can often start harming your site's global SEO rating, as search engines interpret this as neglecting content freshness.

### Content Removal Strategies

You have two primary options:

1. **Delete the article**
2. **Keep the article with modifications**

### 2.1 Deleting Irrelevant Articles

Simply put, if the article provides no value and is not worth rewriting or updating, delete it.

By default, any backlinks to the article will show a 404 (Not found) error to users. For better user experience, you could return a 410 (Gone) status code with a clearer error message such as "This article has been removed" rather than the standard "Page not found".

<blockquote>
Whether you return a 404 (Not found) or a 410 (Gone) status code, according to Google, will not impact SEO differently.
<br><br>
"Currently Google treats 410s (Gone) the same as 404s (Not found), so it's immaterial to us whether you return one or the other."

</blockquote>

### 2.2 Keeping Outdated Articles

If you've identified an old, outdated article but decided to keep it, you could implement several strategies:

**Technical Implementation:**
```html
<head>
  <meta property="og:type" content="article" />
  <meta property="article:published_time" content="2021-10-31" />
  <meta property="article:expiration_time" content="2023-02-16" />
</head>
```

Adding `article:expiration_time` Open Graph metadata could provide extra information to search engines that you've identified this article as expired. Whilst no one definitively knows how search engines rank pages, this is an educated approach with minimal negative impact.

**User Experience Improvements:**
- Add a prominent note at the top indicating the content is outdated
- Hide the article from your main blog listing whilst keeping the URL accessible
- Provide links to newer, relevant content where applicable

## 3. Content Misalignment with Brand Evolution

As your blog progresses, your niche, style of writing, or attitude may change, making some older articles irrelevant to your current direction.

It's very common for blogs to pivot as they mature. Your audience may have developed preferences for specific content that some older articles no longer serve.

### Decision Framework

Consider these factors when evaluating misaligned content:

- **Audience overlap**: Does the old content serve any current readers?
- **SEO value**: Is the article bringing valuable organic traffic?
- **Brand consistency**: Does keeping it harm your current brand image?
- **Resource cost**: Is updating worth the time investment?

**Options vary by article:**
- **Delete**: For content completely off-brand
- **Update**: For salvageable articles with good SEO performance  
- **Archive**: Keep accessible but remove from main navigation
- **Redirect**: Point to more relevant current content

## Content Audit Best Practices

When conducting a **blog content audit**, consider these systematic approaches:

### Regular Maintenance Schedule
- **Quarterly reviews**: Check articles published 18+ months ago
- **Annual deep audits**: Comprehensive review of all content
- **Performance monitoring**: Track traffic and engagement metrics

### Audit Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Technical accuracy and relevance
- [ ] Alignment with current brand/niche
- [ ] SEO performance metrics
- [ ] User engagement data
- [ ] Backlink profile strength

### Cross-Platform Considerations

If you cross-post content to platforms like DEV.to or Medium using canonical links, remember to clean those platforms as well. Maintaining consistency across all your content channels ensures optimal SEO distribution and prevents confusion.

## My Personal Approach

I tend to use a mixture of all the approaches mentioned above. There is no set rule—just whatever works for the specific article you're considering cleaning up. If you ever come across my blog, just know that the articles on my website may not represent everything I've ever written. There are very likely more articles I have deleted than articles currently active on my blog.

In fact, if you visited my blog shortly after 16th August 2025, there's a very good chance you saw very few articles. I cleared out **a lot** of articles that were no longer relevant or didn't align with my current niche and writing style, which actually left me with not very many articles.

Since I cross-post articles using canonical links to send SEO authority from other platforms back to my original articles, I also had to remember to clean those external platforms when auditing my main blog.

## Conclusion

**Yes, you should clean out your blog and maintain it regularly.** Blog cleaning provides numerous benefits including improved SEO performance, enhanced user experience, and better brand alignment.

**Blog maintenance** doesn't necessarily mean deleting articles—it means staying on top of your content so your articles can provide maximum value to you, your blog, and your audience. Whether through updates, redirects, or strategic removal, regular content audits ensure your blog remains a valuable, trustworthy resource.

The key is developing a systematic approach that balances SEO preservation with content quality, ensuring your blog continues to serve both search engines and readers effectively.
