I could feel myself approaching a burnout because I was doing something developer-related almost all day, every day. It's fair to say I was getting a little bored of coding at that time and I just needed something else to do. Since I've always wanted to write an ebook at some point in my career, I felt now (summer "},{type:b,tag:x,props:{dateTime:l},children:[{type:a,value:l}]},{type:a,value:") would be a perfect time to start, and would be a nice break from constant coding."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"At such a young age, I've felt for a long time that I've achieved so much in so little time and have made some really good choices with my career that I feel were the best choices for me.

Don't worry, I wasn't made redundant for any other reason than the company I was employed at as an apprentice went bankrupt. From what I've gained in such little time and the knowledge I do know about levelling up careers, I decided to base the topic of my ebook on this - this ebook has become very popular primarily amongst new\u002Fjunior developers.

This ties in really well with being green and looking after the environment by not using a lot of paper and ink.
